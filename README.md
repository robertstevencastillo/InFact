# InFact - a small clone of the job searching website, Indeed.com

Currently this app can:

- make a request to the Github jobs api
- return a list of jobs from the GitHub jobs api and display them in a seperate page
- each job results page displays five jobs from the github jobs api
- display details about a single job in a seperate job
- navigate back to the search results page from a job details page

Functionality to be added in the future:

- implement company review search functionality
